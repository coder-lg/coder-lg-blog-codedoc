Oh, hey. If you see this, you might not know who I literally am. I am LG( want privacy for my real name right now for personal reasons.). I am a fan of a lot of things in GitHub. I signed up in GitHub to learn about website making via HTML. Soon, I learnt about Jekyll and started using THAT and it was really, really good. Builds completely in 30 seconds, and works. But, now I use CODEDOC. I got a tech blog(if you wonder why, I am a fan of technology) up in Jekyll because I just love Jekyll. The theme I used before was called Type On Strap. I still use it for my tech blog because of the features it got. 

Now, since I am a tech fan, what are my sources? 
```markdown | answer.md
Articles
```
I learn from articles at :
```markdown | The sources.md
Chrome Unboxed
Android Authority
XDA Developers
9to5Google
and more...

I am a good(maybe, idk) player in chess too. 
My favourite chess youtuber is GothamChess, because he tells chess concisely and comically. Well, not only GothamChess, I like GMHikaru(insane premoving skills, he is supposed to be called the `Prince of Premoves`), and more.

Enough of me talking, go ahead and read a blog!

Oh yeah, and thanks to Tyson Williams for the amazing theme, it is his and I forked it to try it but this is potentially powerful.
