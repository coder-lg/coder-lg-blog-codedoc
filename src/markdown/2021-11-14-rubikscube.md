Now, let me tell you something. 2 years ago, I couldn't solve a Rubik's cube at all. The only time I remember solving it was by reassembling it. Looking at the POV of a solver is hard, since Rubik's Cubes hav
e 6 faces or colours, and most people solve only one colour. But here, I will teach you all to solve ALL the colours in 1 hour.

I learnt this from a few videos, if you want, watch them:

In that video, it is from a speedcuber's perspective. After solving the second layer, stop and jump to the next videos and trust me, it's worth it in the end.

So, that is the video edition. This is the text edition, which is easy for beginners to understand.

### How to position the cube

Now, every person needs to position the cube with the yellow color facing upward and white downward. If you don't have a cube like that, I'm literally lost :(
### Understanding the cube

First, you must understand the pieces.
#### The pieces
##### The corner piece
Now, the corner piece has three colors. This is the piece you see in your corners, ie. Yellow facing upwards, blue facing me and white facing downwards. The piece which has orange, yellow and blue is a corner piece. 

There are 8 corner pieces in a rubik's cube.

##### The edge piece

The edge pieces is the piece with two colors in it. By now, you must have recognised it. So, let's move on. A lot of topics to cover.

##### The center piece

Well, you know this one. But this is a crazy piece, since it doesn't move. It is locked in one place. Even if you have a scrambled cube and a solved one, the centers won't move, since they hold the cube together.

#### Layers

Once the yellow color faces upward, see the color which faces you. Instead of taking it as a color, take it as horizontal **layers**.

For example, I positioned _my_ cube with yellow facing upwards, white downwards and red facing me. Now, I take my bottom layer as the one with a white edge piece, and two corner pieces, with one being blue, red and white and the other being green, red and white.
I take my second layer as a blue+red edge piece, a red center piece, and a red+green edge piece.

Next, I take my top layer as a blue+yellow+red corner piece, a yellow+red edge piece and a green+yellow+red corner piece. Now, we solve the cube from the bottom layer up.

### Step 1: Solving the White side and the bottom layer.

This step will solve the white side and the bottom layer.

So, we must make a white cross in the first place, this will help us finish the white side.

So, first, locate all the white edge pieces. Then, push them to the yellow center. This must form a daisy-kind of shape.

Next, observe the adjacent edge color to the white edge pieces. If it's orange, find the orange centre piece, align it vertically and rotate it by 180 degrees. Repeat the same process till you have a white cross at the bottom.

Next, check for outward facing white corner pieces. _Ignore_ the top color. Get it? Ignore. Check the adjacent color to white(not the top one pls dude) and align that color diagonally with it's center color.

Then perform the Right Trigger(you'll need to remember this, R, U, R', U'), which is turning the right face up 90 degrees, the Up face left side once, the right side down once and the up face right side once. It sohould be inside. If it's on the left side, do this: Move the left side once upwards, the up face right side once, the left side once below, and the up face left (L', U', L, U).

Repeat till you solve it.

Only the most cautious person will see this. If you did see this, you are awesome :)
