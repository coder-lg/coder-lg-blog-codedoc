# How we got HERE:

In everyone's lives, there is this one moment in which we would think, How can I host a website?

Trust me, I thought the same.

Before I created the GitHub account, I always wantes a website. A simple blog where I publish articles, like this and my Jekyll Type-On-Strap blog. And one day, I heard about GitHub Pages. 

So, I made an account here. And I made some repositories of my Python projects here. Then, I found out the method of hosting a GitHub Pages website. I made my first website repository and had plain, simple HTML. Then, one day, I heard about Jekyll.

It was great, because, it had the simplicity I always wanted. So, I found the best method to do that, and I did it. I had a favicon set up, and used the Minima theme. Try that once, it is just simply cool. The white aesthetic, just like an iPhone retail box's outside box.

Then, I heard about Type-On-Strap. Immediately, I started using that. I really loved it. Very cool, and had what I wanted: dark mode. 

Then, one day, I was scrolling and I found issue 302, and there, I found Tyson Williams' blog, which led me to coding.blog, which led me to CODEDOC and this blog. This blog is maily programming and cool things you can do, but I still have Type-On-Strap. I love both these themes, and the configuration level in both of them is high. Like, very high.

So, the next thing I did HERE was:

1. Make a wiki
2. Edit the entire site and add footer icons(how WOW is that?)
3. Make this.

Now, before we compare, I told <kbd>HOW WE GOT HERE</kbd>. I forgot to tell <kbd>What is CODEDOC?</kbd>

<!--First Revision-->

But BEFORE we go into CODEDOC, you must know about <kbd>Jekyll</kbd>

# <kbd>Jekyll</kbd>

Jekyll is a static-site generator, and static sites are the sites that use very less time to load on, and is very fast.

Now, you have a LOT of themes in Jekyll. You have Type-On-Strap, Chirpy, Hydejack, Hyde, and more also. And, it mainly uses HTML and CSS. Optional JS or TS for dynamic things.

Now, Jekyll is actually on Ruby, which is a programming language. If you want Jekyll, you follow these steps inside the terminal.
```bash
> Get Ruby from https://rubygems.org
gem install jekyll bundle
> Installs Jekyll and Bundle which executes "jekyll serve"
mkdir my-awesome-jekyll-site
> Make a new dir for the site
cd my-awesome-jekyll-site
> Change your dir to the site.
jekyll new
> Make a new Jekyll site
bundle install
> Installs dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve
> Starts the Jekyll server. Access at http://localhost:4000
```

These 5 commands are basic for a Jekyll site.

However, you can have another Jekyll theme, like Type On Strap. Just download, extract the ZIP and open Terminal into the directory, and run:
```bash
bundle install
> Install dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve
> Starts the server and is acccessible on http://localhost:4000
```
You use Markdown for the blogs, and you can configure the entire site with the `_config.yml` file in the root directory of your site.

But, you need the YAML Front matter. Just search it[suggested to search it](:Footnote) or get it on the Type On Strap Readme.

The entire layout of the directories in Type On Strap[almost same everywhere](:Footnote):

```bash
Type-on-Strap
├── _includes	               #--> theme includes
├── _layouts                   #--> theme layouts (see below for details)
├── _portfolio	               #--> collection of article to be populated in the portfolio page
├── _posts                     #--> Blog posts
├── _sass                      #--> Sass partials 
├── assets
|  ├── js	               #--> theme javascript, Katex, jquery, bootstrap, jekyll search, 
|  ├── css                     #--> isolated Bootstrap, font-awesome, katex and main css
|  ├── fonts		       #--> Font-Awesome, and other fonts
|  └── img		       #--> Images used for the template
├── pages
|   ├── 404.md		       #--> To be displayed when url is wrong
|   ├── about.md               #--> About example page
|   ├── gallery.md             #--> Gallery page for your photos
|   ├── portfolio.md	       #--> Portfolio page for your projects
|   ├── search.html	       #--> Search page
|   └── tags.md                #--> The tag page
├── _config.yml                #--> sample configuration but real config
├── _data
|  ├── authors.yml             #--> Update the post authors configurations 
|  ├── language.yml            #--> Localization configuration
|  ├── social.yml              #--> Social configurations to share posts (RSS, shares, ...)
|  └── icons.yml               #--> Footer icons (Twitter, Github, Stackoverflow, ...)
└── index.html                 #--> sample home page (blog page paginated)
```
It has extra directories that users can use, which proves that it is a custom-made and POWERFUL theme.

Now, let's get into CODEDOC.

# What is <kbd>CODEDOC</kbd>

CODEDOC is another site generator that uses TS, TSX, and markdown. If you want the course on markdown, click down below:

> :ArticleCard src=/2021-07-27_mdch2

Basically, it is actually CLI and is a NodeJS project. Hence the TS, TSX.

But, it is really equal to Jekyll. The best way to get up and running is this:

```bash
> Make sure you have Node JS
npm i -g @codedoc/cli
> Installs Codedoc CLI
mkdir codedoc-test && cd codedoc-test
> Makes and goes into the directory.
codedoc init
> Initialises the CODEDOC site
codedoc install && codedoc serve
> Installs deps, serves the site.
codedoc build
> Builds a deployable site for GH Pages/Netlify/Vercel
```

# Comparison

1. Both have Front Matter
2. Both are cli
3. Both are cool.
4. Both are path-based
5. CODEDOC supports dark mode globally, but Jekyll needs stylesheets.
6. CODEDOC and Jekyll serve to 3000 and 4000
7. IDK, you guess it. Try them though, they are cool.

Can't believe two revisions were enough.

See you later!


And, if you made it this far, you are awesome.
