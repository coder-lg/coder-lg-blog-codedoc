If you happened to see this, you must know about GitHub and Markdown. But what in the world is Markdown?

Well, Markdown is a markup language(don't get fooled by the name) and is based on HTML but simplified.

Like, if you think, Markdown is like this:
```markdown | markdown.md
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

whereas HTML is like this:
```html | html.html
<h1>Header 1</h1>
<h2>Header 2</h2>
<h3>Header 3</h2>
<h4>Header 4</h2>
<h5>Header 5</h2>
<h6>Header 6</h2>
```
As you saw, Markdown is much simpler to type too.

Now, go get Typora, a good, simple and minimal Markdown editor and put the code there(both HTML and Markdown) and look at the preview. Markdown responds to HTML. But, if you try adding this:
```markdown | mdtest2.md
# Header 1
```
in a random HTML file, you just won't see it. 

It is like this:
Markdown responds directly to HTMl but HTML doesn't.

Markdown is like HTML but HTML isn't like Markdown.

So, till now, you have come here. Stay tuned because I am going to upload another blog with Markdown syntax.

And yes, it will be on my Jekyll site too.
