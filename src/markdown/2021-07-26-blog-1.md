Good upgrade, bad mistake

Good news + bad news

Bad news: my official github blog, the one I had with 200 commits and more, is gone :sad: angry

I wish, if GitHub reads this, they will send me an email that my official blog can be reclaimed. I would be happy to get that.

Good news?

I started a tech blog.

Not so bad. Because, tech is one big part of our life.

So, if you wanna read the first post, click the button here and head over to the first post and if and only IF you want, sub the RSS. See ya!
