Now, I know what you'd be thinking. Why the heck is the Rubik's cube guide not out yet?

It's really long, it'd take me a <!--full--> month to make it.

But why this? Because I will make the blog today, use PR Scheduler to merge this tomorrow at 5:30 PM IST. Then, a secret webhook will deliver a call to coding.blog's CDN and my blog will be out.

So, as usual, I was cycling through Google Discover when I spotted an article by XDA([here](https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-pac-man-edition-wallpapers-animations-sounds-download/)). The Oneplus Nord 2 Pac Man Edition is out.

When I was a kid, I used to kinda play Pac-Man for 5 minutes and just give up. The retro game is hard for me to crack. But a few weeks back, I got Pac-Man 256. Endless. Like Infinity Loop and Subway Surfers.

But what's crazy _here_ is that OnePlus released the Pac-Man edition with a custom ROM of OxygenOS, of course. But what's crazy is this list of crazy things:

- New boot animation(if you get the custom Nord 2 and boot it up for the first time, bet you'll see Pac-Man eating the Nord logo and replacing it with power pellets(imagination))
- Crazy wallpapers, live and static.
- New icon pack.

So, this is a review.

## Let's get started with the wallpapers.

They look cool. I swear. If you check [the article by `XDA`](https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-pac-man-edition-wallpapers-animations-sounds-download/), a modder named `linuxct` did it. He did it, I swear.

So, there were three links to files(?). I got two of them, since the last one needed a Magisk-rooted device and I don't want my device to be rooted. But the two files were enough. Those were ZIP archives.

I unzipped the wallpapers file and applied the last one. Love the gradient.

Then, I unzipped the icon+live wallpapers archive. I couldn't install the icon pack(that's what I get for being on Pie) but I managed to get the live wallpapers. They work as prescribed(not a medicine lolz).

In the ZIP file, you get an icon pack APK, a lve wallpaper package that's hidden but has the data, don't worry, you can delete the app from within Settings, just go to your Apps section, open the app list inside that and delete that if you want to. But after that, you get the mod app that allows you to apply the live wallpapers. Trust me, they aren't ghastly at all. If my phone had 120 Hz refresh rate, it'd have been more cool.

This is lind of like a Twitter tweet(says the oe that doesn't have an account for twitter) but it's cool, I love this.

See ya later! And if you want the links for downloading the ZIPs, go to the XDA article linked above.
